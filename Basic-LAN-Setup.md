# 🖧 Basic LAN Setup – Cisco Packet Tracer Lab

## ✅ Objective

Set up a Local Area Network (LAN) with 2–4 PCs using a switch. Each PC will be configured with a static IP address, and we will verify successful communication using the ping command.

---

## 🧰 What I Did

1. **Added 4 PCs** and a **switch** in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Connected each PC to the switch using **straight-through Ethernet cables**.
3. Assigned **static IP addresses** to each PC manually:
   - Example IPs: `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.1.2`, `192.168.1.3`, `192.168.1.4`
4. Used the **Command Prompt** on each PC to:
   - Run `ping` tests between devices
   - Confirm proper communication across the LAN
